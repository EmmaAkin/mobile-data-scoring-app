STRIDE WORLD [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JulienPageaud/mobile-data-scoring-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JulienPageaud/mobile-data-scoring-app)

An application designed to provide people with a way to access loans who would otherwise be unable to due to a lack of financial history.

A large proportion of the South African population do not have bank accounts. Stride will allow users to sign up and give access to their mobile data which will be analysed and used to give the users a credit score.
This will then allow the users to apply for a loan.
